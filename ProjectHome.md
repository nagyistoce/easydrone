The Parrot A.R. Drone is a popular Quadrocopter which is usually controlled via an IPhone or Android App. In the javadrone project on google code a Java API has been built to control it remotely (http://code.google.com/p/javadrone/).

We utilize this API to build a layer on top of it with easier movement commands and some complex behaviours as face detection/face following and tag recognition.

These commands are integrated into a GUI where you can compose your movement scripts in a simple way and afford the drone to fly autonomously.
